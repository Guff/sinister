sinister
========
sinister is a simple, interactive, python-based plotting/graphing application.
Hopefully, it will be fairly quick and easy to customize.

Possible future features include:
* embedded interactive ython interpreter
* history/logging
* configuration file, likely done as a python script

under the hood
--------------
sinister is written for python 3, and uses pygobject in order to make use of
GTK and cairo et al.

issues
------
well, right now, it doesn't really do much. and there are still issues with the
few things it does do:
* plotting works, but there are a few kinks (most obvious is how it handles
    discontinuities)
* the status bar currently uses a monospace font out of programmer laziness. it
    needs to be redone somewhat so that it can handle variable-width fonts
    without acting spastically
* plotting is pretty slow. i don't really know how other plotting programs
    actually do it, but i'm thinking a speed-up could result from making the
    plotting delta adaptive. instead of evaluating the function (and thus
    drawing a line segment) at every multiple of the delta, we could have the
    delta be a function of |f'(x)|; i.e. small derivative means a larger delta
    and vice versa. then, a b√©zier curve could be drawn between each pair of
    points, making use of the derivatives to calculate the control points.
    a potential drawback is that cairo might draw curves substantially slower
    than line segments. i dunno. i'll look into it 
* dragging the plot area around to change the viewport works as far as i can
    tell, but it's slow to the point of being unusable. i'll do some profiling
    first, but the first thing that comes to mind is buffering. i.e. make each
    plot surface's size some multiple of the widget's size and on each redraw,
    draw the entire surface. then, a redraw would only be needed when the limits
    of the surface are exceeded. but this seems less than ideal. perhaps the
    possible plotting speed-up mentioned above would make redraws quick enough
    so that dragging wouldn't matter
